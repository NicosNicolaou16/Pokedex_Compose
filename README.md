# Pokedex_Compose
This Pokedex - Pokemon app is a project that contain and apply the latest Android technologies recommended by Google such as Jetpack Compose, the new way to build the design.
Also, it contains some other important technologies such as Room Database, KSP, Hilt Dependencies Injection, the new Shared Element Transaction and new Navigation Type Safety.

# The Project Contain the following technologies
The programming language is the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html), it is a modern, JVM-based programming language that is concise, safe, and interoperable with Java. <br />
The UI is build using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose). <br />
For Navigation between screens is use the [New Navigation Type Safety](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/navigation-compose-meet-type-safety-e081fb3cf2f8). <br />
For Animation and Navigation from the main screen to details screen is use the new [Shared Element Transition](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/animation/shared-elements) - [Shared Element Transition](https://fvilarino.medium.com/shared-element-transitions-in-jetpack-compose-8f553078101e) - [Shared Element Transition](https://getstream.io/blog/shared-element-compose/).  <br />
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is responsible for making requests and retrieving data from the remote server. ([Repository](https://github.com/square/retrofit)) <br />
[Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) is responsible for saving the retrieved data from the remote server, querying data from the local database, and supporting offline functionality.  <br />
[Palette](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/palette-colors) is used to retrieve the color from the image; in our case, we are using the Pok√©mon color to paint the linear indicator with the same color. <br />
[KSP](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp) ("Kotlin Symbol Processing") is a tool for efficient annotation processing in Kotlin, providing faster code generation and symbol manipulation compared to KAPT.. [Repository](https://github.com/google/ksp) <br />
